# High-dimensional-Random-Forest

The rapid increase of high-dimensional datasets across various domains presents significant challenges in data analysis, particularly in classification and regression tasks. Traditional Random Forest (RF) algorithms, while robust, often struggle with datasets filled with numerous noisy or non-informative features, compromising both performance and accuracy. This dissertation introduces an advanced algorithm, High-Dimensional Random Forests (HDRF), designed to address these challenges by integrating robust multivariate feature selection techniques directly into the decision tree construction process. Unlike standard RF, HDRF incorporates ridge regression-based variable screening at each decision split, enhancing its ability to effectively identify and utilize the most informative features. We conducted extensive simulation studies to demonstrate HDRF's superior performance in managing high-dimensional noise and improving predictive accuracy. Furthermore, HDRF's efficacy is validated through real-world applications in a residential housing dataset for regression tasks and a prostate cancer dataset for classification, showcasing its potential in practical, high-stakes environments. This work not only extends the capabilities of ensemble learning models in handling complex datasets but also sets a precedent for future research in algorithmic enhancements for high-dimensional data analysis.
